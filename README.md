# CouterApp_01
Counter app using Html , CSS and JS

In this project I have used basic HTML elements and added classes to the required elements.
Styled the basic page with CSS. Used concepts like CSS variables , margin , padding, flex boxetc
Used Javascript to add the functionality and concepts used as 
js variables , queryselector , eventHandlers , classList , functions , innerText etc

Main concept learnt from this project .
As you can see I have added icons to the buttons like up-arrow , down-arrow but when we click on these icons the functionality did not work because I did not add same classes to the icons as of button . if we add the same classes to icons as per respective button this little bug is resloved
